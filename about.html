            Women as a community are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  11 years ago, I began my own journey as a woman working in the field of technology. During that time, I have become exceedingly aware of a gender imbalance in the workplace. In February 2021, I plunged into research regarding gender inequality in STEM occupations. Over the course of my graduate career, I discovered my passion for making socio-cultural progress using data visualizations. During this time, I found myself focusing on challenges specific to women. For this semester-long project I used data and technology to retaliate against the biases of their own industries. I gathered, cleaned, and analyzed data regarding gender and technology occupations. Additionally, I created a platform in the form of a website where I could visualize these data findings and build upon the project in the future. This would prove that not only are women capable of exceeding in STEM, but the data supports it. To attempt this operation, I met with my advisor, Professor Serr. My advisor guided me though developing this idea into a practical and cohesive capstone project, that I now refer to as Envision Equality.

            Throughout this project, design decisions have been a major component. On Envision Equality, everything from colors to fonts were carefully considered factors. It was important that the final output of this project felt bold, groundbreaking, and sophisticated. A good deal of inspiration was taken from observing how high-end tech product pages looked and functioned. Blues, golds, and grays were used to contrast the dark background and create cohesion throughout the various webpages. I chose to avoid sharp corners in the navigation and stock images to give the site a modern and relevant tone. Additionally, the same colors were assigned to represent men and women to increase legibility, and small caps were used in visualizations and throughout the website to highlight important text. The resulting website and data visualizations are featured here.
