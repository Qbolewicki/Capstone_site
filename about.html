            <p>In the U.S. a significant population is facing an uphill battle 
            trying to thrive in an industry that has seen exponential growth in recent 
            years. Women, who account for approximately 50.8% of the U.S.  
            are statistically underpaid and underrepresented in science, technology, 
            engineering, and mathematics (STEM).</p>
            <p>Despite women-led technology teams 
            establishing a 21% greater return on investment than teams who donâ€™t, and 
            young women largely outperforming men in math according to a 2015 study, there 
            are only three fortune 500 companies led by women, and they comprise only 10% 
            of internet entrepreneurs.  Research generates hundreds of articles, 
            infographics, and reports showing that women are capable of, yet not 
            thriving in the field of technology.</p>
            <p>U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 
            and PayScale have provided data from the past 6 years on top tech companies 
            demographics and salaries. Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS,
            this webpage was published as a tool to
            visualize and display data in the form of charts and infographics. 
            The visualizations featured on this platform serve to raise awareness 
            around the issue of gender discrimination in the field of technology and 
            start a dialogue which address it.</p>
