    In the United States, a significant population is facing an uphill battle trying to thrive in an industry that has seen exponential growth in recent years. Women, who account for approximately 50.8% of the U.S. population  are statistically underpaid and underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  Despite women-led technology teams establishing a 21% greater return on investment than teams who don’t, and young women largely outperforming men in math according to a 2015 study, there are only three fortune 500 companies led by women, and they comprise only 10% of internet entrepreneurs.  Research generates hundreds of articles, infographics, and reports showing that women are capable of, yet not thriving in technology occupations.

    <i>Brent Ozar Unlimited</i> and <i>PayScale</i> have provided data from the past 7 years on top tech companies demographics and salaries. I have analyzed this data using various statistical methods and created Envision Equality. Using this platform, I’ve visualized and displayed data from these sources in the form of charts and infographics. The intention of this project is to start a dialogue surrounding the issue of gender discrimination in the technology occupations, and begin to address it.
