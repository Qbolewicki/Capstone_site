    Women are facing an uphill 
    battle trying to thrive in an industry that has seen exponential growth 
    in recent years. They are statistically underpaid and underrepresented in science, 
    technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Despite women-led technology teams 
    establishing a 21% greater return on investment than teams who donâ€™t, and 
    young women largely outperforming men in math according to a 2015 study, there 
    are only three fortune 500 companies led by women, and they comprise only 10% 
    of internet entrepreneurs.

    The visualizations featured on this platform serve to raise awareness around the 
    issue of gender discrimination in the field of technology and start a dialogue which 
    address it.
